#### Who I am

My name is Jose Victor Herrera. I am a web and application developer in Los Angeles, CA.
I've been programming for over seven years and am happy to have made a career out of something I truly enjoy.
Learning is my passion and it has been my motivation to continuously improve.

#### What I do

**For myself**, I experiment with new technologies and languages related to web.
**For Square**, I work on the Shop team.
I write code in `Ruby`, `Python`, `Javascript`, and `PHP`.

#### Where I'm headed
After reaching my previous goal of earning my Bachelor's Degree in
Computer Science, I continue to look forward to delving deeper into
the depths of Computer Science through the engineering of succint solutions to
complex problems as they arise in my position at Square.
