In 2021, I completed the Computer Science Online Degree Completion program at California State University Monterey Bay.
In my time there, I was able to learn about the intricacies of computer systems as well as development
in various programming languages and frameworks. Additionally, we focused on design as well as the ethical dilemmas
we may face in this career. All in all, it was a great experience which I feel has made me a better software engineer.

As part of my coursework I put together the following:

| | |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **[Weekly Learning Journal](https://journal.csumb.josevh.com/)**  | A place to keep track of the things I've learned on a week-to-week basis. |
| **[Portfolio](https://portfolio.csumb.josevh.com)**               | A place to showcase my major pieces of coursework per course.             |

Please feel free to check them out!
