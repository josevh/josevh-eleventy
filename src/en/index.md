#### Hello there 👋

I'm Jose. I'm a software engineer passionate about building things that make people's lives a little easier. I recently worked at Square, where I solved interesting problems that blended technology with real-world impact.

#### What I care about

I focus on creating thoughtful solutions to complex challenges. Recently, that's meant:
- Helping merchants in Japan access installment payment options for hardware purchases
- Making checkout flows smoother for customers across the globe
- Ensuring financial systems work reliably behind the scenes

I believe good engineering isn't just about writing code, it's about understanding people's needs and building systems that serve them well.

#### Beyond the code

When I'm not at the keyboard, you might find me:
- Having fun with my kids
- Traveling with a camera in-hand
- Learning new songs on my Uke
- Experimenting with new programming languages or frameworks just for fun
- Working on side projects that combine different interests

#### My approach

I've been programming for over seven years, and what keeps me going is the constant opportunity to learn. Whether it's mastering a new technology or understanding a complex system, I love the process of breaking things down and figuring them out.

I value clean, thoughtful code, collaborative problem-solving, and building things that last. I'm at my best when I'm working on challenging problems with people who care about doing good work.
